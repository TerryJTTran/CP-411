## Q1 Graphics pipeline (short answer)
	
### Q1.1 Primitives

Graphic primitives is essential the basic element of graphics. The building blocks that graphics are derived from, examples are dots, line segments, triangles, and polygons. Its relation to graphics objects is that to create these objects its requires these primitives to represent the object. What graphics pipeline does to primitives is use them to create a model of the 3D object and then turn them to pixels to then render them in the frame buffer.

### Q1.2 Coordinate systems & transformations

The coordinate systems involved in graphics pipeline are the modeling, world, viewer, normalized device, and screen coordinate systems. Each coordinate system dealing with a specific stage in the graphics pipeline process. The transformations involved in the graphics pipeline are the modeling, viewing, projection, and display transformations. Each transformation is connected with the conversion of two coordinate systems.

### Q1.3 Scan conversion

A scan conversion algorithm will convert primitives into pixels to be sent to the frame buffer.
