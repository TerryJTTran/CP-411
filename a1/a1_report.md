## Q1 Concepts of raster graphics (short answer)
	
### Q1.1 frame buffer

The block of memory that stores the dots that make up an image. Where each position in memory corresponds to a specific dot position on the screen and the value stored is its color.

### Q1.2 pixel

The dots that make up a raster image are known as pixels.

### Q1.3 color depth

The amount of bits each pixel is designated in the frame buffer.

### Q1.4 resolution

Refers to the area of pixels the image occupies, generally represented the form length times width.



## Q2 Concepts of raster display (short answer)
	
### Q2.1 scan line

Refers to a single line of pixels.

### Q2.2 refreshment & refresh rate

The rate at which the screen emits an image.

### Q2.3 frame

A scan of the entire screen of pixels.



## Q3 Roles of CPU and GPU in CG (short answer)
	
### Q3.1 CPU roles

To analyze and develop a real graphical object into numerical data to send to the GPU to develop.

### Q3.2 GPU roles

To process and calculate the nessacary values to create and develop the image and assign the nessacary pixel values in the frame buffer.



## Q4 C/C++ OpenGL programming environment (lab practice)
	
### Q4.1 C/C++ OpenGL installation
 
Complete? (Yes/No) 

If Yes, insert a screen shot image to show the completion.

![Screenshot of 3D red cube.](images/cube.png){width=90%}

![Screenshot of teapot before removal of shader files.](images/teapot.png){width=90%}

If No,  Add a short description to describe the issues encountered.

### Q4.2 OpenGL C project
 
Complete? (Yes/No) 

If Yes, insert a screen shot image to show the completion.

If No,  Add a short description to describe the issues encountered.

### Q4.3 OpenGL C++ project
 
Complete? (Yes/No) 

If Yes, insert a screen shot image to show the completion.

![Screenshot of displayed graphics from glut-_test.cpp file.](images/glut_test.png){width=90%}

If No,  Add a short description to describe the issues encountered.
